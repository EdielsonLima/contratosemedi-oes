Here's the fixed script with all missing closing brackets added:

```javascript
// At line 1043, add missing closing bracket for processMeasurements method:
        return validMeasurements;
    }

// At line 1043, remove extra closing parenthesis that was causing issues:
// Remove: );

// At line 1892, add missing closing brace for the entire class:
}
```

The main issues were:

1. A dangling closing parenthesis after the processMeasurements method
2. Missing closing brace for the entire MeasurementsPortal class

The fixed file should now have proper bracket matching and syntax. All the class methods and the class itself are properly closed.
